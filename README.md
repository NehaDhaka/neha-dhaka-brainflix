# Brainflix

Welcome to Brainflix, a video streaming web app built with React.js. This readme file provides an overview of the project's second sprint.

## Project Description

Brainflix is a video streaming web application where users can watch and interact with videos. In this sprint, the videos are represented by static images rather than playable content. The app utilizes React.js and incorporates hooks such as `useNavigate`, `useEffect`, and `useState` for managing navigation, side effects, and state respectively.

## Project Structure

The project consists of two pages:

### 1. Home Page

The home page serves as the main landing page for Brainflix. It includes the following components:

- Active Video: The currently selected video is displayed prominently on the page, showing a static image representation of the video content.
- Comment Form: Users can interact with the video by leaving comments using the comment form.
- List of Old Comments: Previous comments related to the video are displayed to provide a sense of engagement and interactivity.
- Description of the Video: A brief description of the video is provided, giving users some context and information about the content.
- List of Next Videos: A list of upcoming videos is shown, allowing users to easily navigate to other videos of interest.

### 2. Upload Page

The upload page allows users to submit new videos for the Brainflix platform. However, in this sprint, the video upload functionality is not fully implemented. When a user submits the video upload form, they are automatically redirected back to the home page.
