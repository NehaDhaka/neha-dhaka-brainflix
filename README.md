# Brainflix - Sprint 3

## Project Description

Brainflix is a video streaming web application built with React.js. In this sprint, several new features and improvements have been added to enhance the user experience.

## Project Structure

The project consists of two main pages:

### Home Page

The home page serves as the main landing page for Brainflix. It includes the following components:

#### Active Video

The currently selected video is displayed prominently on the page, showing a static image representation of the video content.

#### Comment Form

Users can interact with the video by leaving comments using the comment form.

#### List of Old Comments

Previous comments related to the video are displayed to provide a sense of engagement and interactivity.

#### Description of the Video

A brief description of the video is provided, giving users some context and information about the content.

#### List of Next Videos

A list of upcoming videos is shown, allowing users to easily navigate to other videos of interest.

#### Like Functionality

Users can now like a video by clicking on the "Like" button. The number of likes is displayed for each video.

### Upload Page

The upload page has been enhanced in this sprint and now includes a functional form for video uploads. The following improvements have been made:

#### Video Thumbnail

Users can choose whether or not to upload a thumbnail image for their video.

#### Video Upload Form

The form allows users to enter details such as the video title, description, and choose a video file to upload.

#### Express Server

The mock API used in the previous sprint has been replaced by an actual Express server built for this project. This server handles video uploads and serves the necessary data to the frontend.
